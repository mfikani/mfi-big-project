/*
 Differences between extending Thread or implementing Runnable interface :  
1- When you extend Thread class, you canï¿½t extend any other class which you require. (As you know, Java does not allow inheriting more than one class). 
   When you implement Runnable, you can save a space for your class to extend any other class in future or now.

However, the significant difference is.

2- When you extends Thread class, each of your thread creates unique object and associate with it. When you implements Runnable, 
   it shares the same object to multiple threads.
